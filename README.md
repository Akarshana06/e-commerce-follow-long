# ⭐ Ecommerce Follow Along Project ⭐

Welcome to the *Ecommerce Follow Along Project*! This hands-on project focuses on building a complete e-commerce application using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

---

## ⭐ Milestone 1: Project Overview

### 🌟 M1. Understanding the MERN Stack
- **MongoDB**: A database for storing application data in a flexible, document-based format.
- **Express.js**: A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logic.
- **React.js**: A framework/library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server.

### 🌟 M2. REST API Structure
- **User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and log in.
- **Product Management**: Adding, updating, and retrieving product data.
- **Order Handling**: Managing customer orders.

### 🌟 M3. Database Schema Design
- Learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB.
- Define schemas to store and manage data relationships.

### 🌟 M4. Authentication
- Ensure users log in to access personal data and place orders.
- Enhance security by verifying user identities.
